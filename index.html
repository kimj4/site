			<h3>Senior Capstone Project</h3>
			<p>
				E-discovery is the process of finding electronic documents that may be
				relevant in a court case. This often takes long hours by a legal team, which
				makes it expensive and prone to error. I am working in a group of six to
				develop a machine learning system to aid in its automation.
			</p>
			<p>
				We are working with the Enron emails dataset, which is the industry
				standard, and are using TF-IDF along with LSA to turn these documents into
				a matrix of numbers that represent their relatedness.
			</p>
			<p>
				This matrix is then used to train a random forest algorithm that's being
				implemented from scratch. This system can then take batches of emails, and
				assign a strength of relevancy. Because of the possibly very high stakes,
				we run these documents by a trained professional, who will decide if the
				returned document is actually relevant. This decision is fed back into the
				system to be used as additional training data.
			</p>
			<p>
				This incremental learning is the part of the project that I am specializing
				in. The random forest is incrementally trained by deleting and recreating
				some number of trees, and updating the leave nodes of all others.

		<h2>Projects</h2>
		<div>
			<h3>CheckMeet</h3>
			<p>
				This is the work I did for Launch5 Media in the summer of 2017. The goal
				was to create a social media app that would allow users to check into
				places much like in Facebook, but allow them to come back to those
				check-ins to see what others said about that place at a certain time.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>NestTimer</h3>
			<p>
				This is a personal project that came from necessity. Sometimes, when I
				have unstructured free time, and tasks that need to be done, but don't
				have a set deadline, I can get lax with them. So I wanted an easy way
				set a certain number of hours that I might allocate to a certain task,
				and allocate some chunk of that time into subtasks that might go into
				accomplishing that. What I ended up with is a timer that can have
				nested timers that then contribute to their parents.
			</p>
			<p>
				This project is developed in native Android in Android Studio and is not
				yet released.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Untitled Android Game</h3>
			<p>
				After taking Computer Graphics, I wanted to venture into the world of
				creating games, and this was my first attempt. This is a simple
				single-gesture avoid-the-obstacle game that involved symmetrical motion
				of two balls.
			</p>
			<p>
				This game is developed in Corona Studio, which takes care of a lot of
				the details involved in making a native app.

			<h3>Reselling Business</h3>
			<p>
				To make a little bit of money on the side, I got into reselling items
				that are pertinent to my hobbies. In the beginning of the year, it was
				computer parts, and now it is custom mechanical keyboards. Working just
				part time, I've moved about 50 items this year which I bought for around
				$5000 total. I sold all of these for a total of around $8500 with
				profits after shipping and platform fees at around $2700.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Trading Cryptocurrency</h3>
			<p>
				From my computer hobby, I ended up with a fairly beefy computer, and I
				didn't like seeing the parts go to waste, so I started mining Ethereum
				when it was around $10. I've sold a couple at those low prices, but I
				held on to about six, which grew astronomically when the cryptocurrency
				craze of 2017 kicked in. I sold off for a virtually infinite profit margin
				and and have been trading some of the earning at the right opportunities.
